## Bill of Materials ##

**Carbon tube:**

- 1 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 16mm, inner diameter 14mm, length 240mm
- 1 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 14mm, inner diameter 12mm, length 1000mm
- 2 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 10mm, inner diameter 8mm, length 469mm
- 2 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 5mm, inner diameter 3mm, length 43mm
- 1 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 5mm, inner diameter 3mm, length 600mm
- 2 X Carbon tube: outer diameter 4mm, inner diameter 2mm, length 56mm


**Propulsion:**

- 2 x GARTT ML 4112 480KV motor, or T-Motor Navigator MN4012 480kV, or equivalent (500W minimum)
- 2 x 14x8 beech wood propellers (length and pitch depend on the motor)
- 2 x 50A 6S ESC BlHeli32 with telemetry (alternatively 40A but not less)


**Servos:**

- 2 x SAVOX SC-1252MG Digital Servo (standard size) or equivalent/better


**Autopilot:**

- 1 x "Ardupilot" compatible flight control (Cube Orange, Pixhawk1 or equivalent), with its dedicated Power Module
- 1 x M8N GPS with compass, Here3 GPS GNSS, or better (alternatively double gps differently oriented)
- 1 x Airspeed Sensor MEAS Spec series (e.g. MS4525DO, MS5525), the analogs did not give good results
- 1 x BEC adequately sized on input/output voltage and maximum servo current, example input 25.2V (6S), output 6V, current 5A
- 1 x SiK Radio Telemetry or other type


**Optional:**

- 2 x JX8 connector, male and female
- 1 x TFmini Plus LIDAR


Various things, such as screws, nuts, power cables, servos extensions and others are not on the list at the moment, and still depend on the build type.
